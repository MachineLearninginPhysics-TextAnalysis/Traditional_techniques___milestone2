# milestone2-traditional-techniques
We want to apply the traditional techniques (not Neural Networks) to the data that we prepared. We have changed the algorithm of our advanced processing method. Actually, we have found a better way to make the inputa and more accuracy will be achieved. So, we will show the processed data in a new way (the raw data is not changed; we just change the processing method).
