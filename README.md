# milestone2--traditional-techniques
We want to apply the traditional techniques (not Neural Networks) to the data that we prepared. We have changed the algorithm of our advanced processing method. Actually, we have found a better way to make the input and more accuracy will be achieved. So, we will show the processed data in a new way (the raw data is not changed; we just change the processing method).

First, see the folder entitled 'New Advanced Processing Method'. In this folder, you will understand that we have found a better way to make the features of our data. This new method, will be more efficient.
Second, see the Main file of milestone_2, entitled 'Traditional Techniques.ipynb'. We have done all parts of milestone_2 in this file. Also, you can see the file 'data_clean.csv', which is the our processed data file; it will be given to 'Traditional Techniques.ipynb' to do processing. Please note that There are note all the data here, and we just put 5000 samples. Because GitHub has 25MB volume limit. Also, we have done everything of milestone_2 with the complete file of data which has a size of about 400MB (on our computer); everything has been OK. If you want to have all new data, please contact machinelearninginphysics@gmail.com or chix4030@gmail.com.
